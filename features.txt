## Feature 1: Therapy with Philosopher AI

A lighthearted, whimsical feature where users can have a short, supportive therapy-style conversation with an AI representing famous philosophers.
Users select a philosopher (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, Socrates, Confucius, Karl Marx) and chat with them.
Conversations are short and capped at ~5 minutes (6–8 messages). 
Users can switch philosophers mid-conversation, and the new philosopher acknowledges the switch and continues based on the existing conversation history.

### Tasks:
- [✓] Design paper prototype showing full conversation flow, philosopher selection, switching, session end, and clear conversation option
- [✓] Draft prompt templates and personalities for each philosopher (tone guide)
- [✓] Build user flow: philosopher selection and session start
- [✓] Implement conversation logic with chat history memory
- [✓] Implement conversation length limit (~6–8 messages)
- [✓] Add philosopher switch function, maintain conversation history
- [✓] Build session end screen with clear call to action (Start New Session)
- [✓] Test with at least two users for usability
- [✓] Update prototype after testing (remove prompt counter, add switch confirmation, adjust button visibility)
- [✓] Add confirmation message when philosopher switch occurs
- [✓] Prepare final GitHub issues and close tasks

Suggestions include brief explanations and helpful tips relevant to the weather, enhancing motivation and ensuring optimal comfort during workouts.

### Tasks:
- [✓] Create initial prototype showing city input, weather fetching, and workout recommendation flow

- [✓] Implement recommendation logic linking weather conditions to workout types
- [✓] Design friendly, informative UI to clearly display workout suggestions and quick tips
- [✓] Add refresh/update capability for current weather check and recommendation update
- [✓] Implement graceful error handling (invalid city input, unavailable weather data)
- [✓] Test feature usability with at least two users
- [✓] Update prototype based on user feedback (clearer city input field, enhanced tip readability)
- [✓] Add visual confirmation for weather data refresh
- [✓] Prepare final GitHub issues and close tasks
