# User Testing Script: 5 Minutes of Therapy with a Philosopher AI

## Participant Introduction
Hello! We are Artificial Artifacts, a team developing a prototype called “5 Minutes of Therapy with a Philosopher.” It’s designed to provide short, supportive conversations with an AI that simulates the philosophical frameworks known for each respective historical philosopher.

Today, you’ll be playing someone who’s feeling mentally overwhelmed and is looking for perspective from these famous philosophers.

Please remember to speak your thoughts out loud as you interact with the app—tell us what you're thinking, trying to do, or expecting before you take any action.

## Results (Post-Test)

### 1. Confusion about ending the session and switching philosophers
- **Observation:** Both participants expressed confusion about how to end the session or confirm a successful philosopher switch.
- **Hypothesis:** End/reset options and the 'Switch Philosopher' button were not visually prominent. Lack of confirmation when switching                      philosophers created uncertainty.
- **Remedy:**
  -  Add clearer language for ending or restarting the session, and visually emphasize the ‘Switch Philosopher’ button using color or an          icon. Consider including a persistent “End Session” button for clarity.
  - Ensure that when switching philosophers, the new philosopher sends a clear confirmation message (e.g., *“Nietzsche joins the                 conversation: 'Ah, we meet in the depths of thought.'”*).

- - - -

### 2. Hesitation to ask questions near the end of the prompt counter
- **Observation:** Participant 2 noted feeling rushed by the prompt counter. Participant 1 hesitated to use remaining prompts.
- **Hypothesis:** The prompt counter creates a sense of limitation or pressure, and it’s unclear what happens when the user runs out of                       prompts. The prompt counter made the conversation feel more like a timed test than a natural flow.
- **Remedy:**
  -  Include a brief explanation next to the prompt counter clarifying what happens when the session ends (e.g. “You can start a new               session anytime”).
  -  OR remove the prompt counter entirely for a smoother, more immersive user experience.
  -  OR remove the prompt counter message but keep the limitations.

- - - -

### 3. Interest in comparing philosopher responses
- **Observation:** Participant 1 expressed curiosity about how different philosophers would answer the same question.
- **Hypothesis:** Users are interested in seeing different philosophical perspectives on the same issue, but the current design doesn’t                       support quick comparisons.
- **Remedy:**
  -  Explore adding a feature like “Compare Philosophers” that allows users to re-ask their last question to another philosopher.
  -  OR quickly toggle between responses to the same input.
 
- - - -

## Updates (for after prototype)

- ✅ Removed the prompt counter message to reduce pressure and improve flow.
- ✅ Added a confirmation message from the new philosopher when switching to improve clarity.
- ⭐️ Explore future enhancement: Implement a sort of "Clear Conversation" button to make end/reset options clearer.
- ⭐️ Explore future enhancement: Add a "Compare Philosophers" option for quick philosophical perspective swaps.



# User Testing Script: Weather & Workout Advice

## Participant Introduction
Hello! We are Artificial Artifacts, a team developing a prototype called “Weather & Workout Advice.” It’s designed to provide personalized workout suggestions based on tomorrow’s weather forecast in your selected city.

Today, you’ll be playing someone who is planning their workout routine and wants to know what kind of advice the app gives based on the weather conditions in different cities.

Please remember to speak your thoughts out loud as you interact with the app—tell us what you're thinking, trying to do, or expecting before you take any action.

## Tasks

### Task 1
You’re in Miami and want to get workout advice for tomorrow. 
**Let us know when you feel like you’ve received the suggestion.**

### Task 2
You’re traveling to Boston and want to check the workout advice there. 
**Let us know when you’ve successfully seen the new recommendation.**


- - - -
## Notes

### Participant 1
- User successfully typed in “Miami” but didn’t realize the advice updated immediately.
- Asked “Do I need to press something?” while searching for a Submit button.
- Tried entering “Boston” but was unsure if the app would respond again.

### Participant 2
- User entered “Miami” and paused, looking for a way to confirm the city input.
- Commented that the workout advice made sense but wasn’t sure if it was actually based on the weather.
- Asked if they could check another city and was unsure how to do it.
- Said the cloud icon confused them when checking Boston’s weather.

## Feedback Questions

### Participant 1
1. **How easy or hard was it to complete the tasks?**   
   “It was easy to type the city, but I wasn’t sure what triggered the advice to show.”
   
2. **Was anything confusing or unclear?**   
   “I thought I had to press Enter or click a button—it wasn’t obvious.”
   
3. **What did you enjoy about the experience?**   
   “I liked how it felt quick once I figured it out.”
   
4. **What would you improve?**   
   “Add a Submit button and make it clearer that the weather has changed.”

**Quotes:**  
> *“Do I need to press something?”*  
> *“How do I check the second city?”*  

- - - -

### Participant 2
1. **How easy or hard was it to complete the tasks?**  
   “The typing part was easy, but I didn’t know if anything actually happened.”

2. **Was anything confusing or unclear?**  
   “I wasn’t sure how to check another city or if the advice even changed.”

3. **What did you enjoy about the experience?**  
   “It was cool that it gave advice based on where I was.”

4. **What would you improve?**  
   “Make a button to switch cities and maybe have the cloud match the weather.”

**Quotes:**  
> *“I thought there’d be a search button.”*  
> *“The cloud confused me. Is it always the same?”*

- - - -

## Results (Post-Test)

### 1. Lack of confirmation after typing the city
- **Observation:** Both participants were unsure if the advice updated after entering a city.
- **Hypothesis:** Without a **Submit** button or confirmation message, users felt uncertain about whether the app responded.
- **Remedy:**
  - ✅ Add a visible **Submit** button for confirming city input.  
  - ✅ Provide a brief message confirming the city and weather-based advice update.

- - - -

### 2. Confusion when checking a second city
- **Observation:** Users didn’t know they could check another city or how to start over.
- **Hypothesis:** The interface didn’t clearly offer a way to reset or repeat the interaction.
- **Remedy:**
  - ✅ Add a **“Check Another City”** button that resets the input and clears old results.  
  - ✅ Ensure instructions or interface guide users to that next action.

- - - -

### 3. Weather icon did not reflect forecast
- **Observation:** Participant 2 expected the weather icon (e.g., sunny or rainy) to match the forecast of the selected city.
- **Hypothesis:** Static icon led to doubt about whether the app was actually weather-driven.
- **Remedy:**
  - ✅ Change the visual icon dynamically depending on the weather forecast.  
     - ☀️ for sunny  
     - 🌧️ for rainy  
     - 🌥️ for cloudy, etc.
 
- - - -

## Updates (for after prototype)

- ✅ Added **Submit** button to confirm city input  
- ✅ Added a **“Check Another City”** button for clarity  
- ✅ Updated weather icon to reflect forecast accurately  
- ✅ Improved layout to keep text and input aligned for better UX
